Rainfall Trend Analysis of Jaipur and Jodhpur Divisions (1980–2020) This project presents a detailed analysis of long-term rainfall trends over the semi-arid (Jaipur Division) and arid (Jodhpur Division) regions of Rajasthan, India, using Mann-Kendall trend test and Z-statistic. 
# 🌧️ Rainfall Trend Analysis (1980–2020) – Jaipur & Jodhpur Divisions, Rajasthan

This repository contains my MTech dissertation project focused on **long-term trend analysis of rainfall** over two major climatic regions of Rajasthan – **Jaipur (semi-arid)** and **Jodhpur (arid)** divisions – using **Mann-Kendall trend test** and **Z-statistic** on daily rainfall data from **1980 to 2020**.
